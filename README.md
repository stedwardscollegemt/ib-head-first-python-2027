# IB Computer Science ‚Äì Python Teaching Notebook Series

Welcome! This repository contains a growing set of **Jupyter Notebooks** designed specifically for teaching programming constructs in alignment with the **IB Computer Science (2025 syllabus) ‚Äì Theme B: Computer Programming**.

The notebooks are structured to closely follow:

- **IB Learning Outcomes** for Theme B (e.g., B2.3.1, B2.1.2, B2.3.3, etc.)
- Chapters from **Head First Python, 3rd Edition** by O‚ÄôReilly
- Realistic and engaging scenarios (card games, file names, swim race data, etc.)
- A gradual development of computational thinking and computational problem-solving skills

## üîç Purpose of the Notebook Series

The aim is to help students not only learn Python syntax, but to **connect it directly to IB terminology**, to practice **tracing, debugging, and constructing** programs, and to internalize core programming constructs like sequence, selection, functions, repetition, data structures, and file processing.

Each notebook includes:

‚úÖ IB learning outcome(s) clearly stated  
‚úÖ Notes and short explanations in Markdown  
‚úÖ Example code aligned with *Head First Python* chapters  
‚úÖ Practical tasks / challenges for students  
‚úÖ Reflection questions or mini debugs to build IB exam-style thinking

## üìö Notebook Roadmap (Term 1)

| Notebook | Main Focus | IB Outcomes | Book Chapter |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **NB1** | Sequential Programs (Card game) | B2.3.1 | HFP Ch. 0 |
| **NB2** | Variables (types, scope, global vs local) | B2.1.1 | HFP Ch. 0‚Äì1 |
| **NB3** | Strings & Substrings | B2.1.2 | HFP Ch. 1 |
| **NB4** | Loops & Debugging | B2.3.3, B2.1.4 | HFP Ch. 2 |
| **NB5** | Selection + Debug (coming soon) | B2.3.2, B2.1.4 | HFP Ch. 2‚Äì3 |

*More notebooks will continue into file handling, functions, static vs dynamic data structures, searching/sorting, etc.*

## üß† Pedagogical Approach

We aim for:

- **Context-rich examples** (e.g., real file names, sports data, music files)
- **Incremental build-up of skills** (one concept per notebook)
- **Scaffolded practice**, with both guided and independent tasks
- **IB language** woven into the markdown (construct, trace, debug, etc.)

This makes it easier for students to connect classroom coding practice with their written exams and with the Internal Assessment (IA) rubric language later on.

## ‚úÖ Status & How to Use

This project is in active development. Notebooks are numbered and can be used week-by-week in a term. Teachers can:

- Download or clone the repo into VS Code or JupyterLab
- Use notebooks during lesson delivery or as homework/revision
- Modify/customize the context to suit topics (e.g., business, sports, music)
