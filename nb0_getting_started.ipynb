    "#### 1. Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "We use *variables* in our programs to store data so that they can be manipulated to give us interesting results. In Python, a variable is given a label or name (identifier) and an '=' is used to assign it a value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The values we assign are generally associated with a particular *type* which usually determines how we intend to manipulate the variable. In the above example, the value we assigned is a whole number (integer), and naturally we would expect the program to perform arithmetic operations on it, because that is what we generally tend to do with numerical values. In programming, we work with various types for various reasons. Normally a particular data type comes with set of rules for behaviour.\n",

    "Booleans (bool) store either `True` or `False`. They are especially useful when we want our programs to make certain decisions (conditional) or control the sequencing of our program in some way (e.g., looping). It is quite rare that we assign a Boolean value as `True` or `False` outright, we normally write comparitive or logical expressions that evaluate to one of these values."

Conceptually, they are no different to the mathematical functions we use on our scientific calculator.\n",

    "\n",
    "Functions become especially powerful in event-driven programming, where execution is not always linear. Many real-world applications fit into this paradigm, for example, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) program that responds to user clicks. Each *click event* can be hooked to a specific function that does the something, whether thatâ€™s opening a file, drawing a shape, or saving progress.\n",
