    "#### Notes on For Loops and While Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways of creating `for` loops in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way is to write a `for` loop that repeats a block of code for each item `in` a sequence that can come from a `list`, `str`, or `file`, to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of looping through a `list` of `\"fruit\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit_seq = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit_item in fruit_seq:\n",
    "    print(fruit_item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**For Loop In `range()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common way of writing a `for` loop makes use of the `range()` function which generates a sequence of numbers. This is useful when you need to repeat an action a *specific number* of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "start, stop, step = 0, 5, 1\n",
    "for counter in range(start, stop, step):\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables `start` and `step` are technically *optional*, meaning, you do not have to specify them in your program. By default, Python will assume that you need to `start` counting from zero and increment by one `step`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember this from `nb1_sequential_programs.ipynb`?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for _ in range(3):\n",
    "    print(draw())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**While Loops in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a *test condition* is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_age = 34\n",
    "while my_age > 18:\n",
    "    print(\"Ugh! I am so old.\")\n",
    "    my_age = my_age - 1\n",
    "print(\"Yay! I am 18 again.\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Some of the most common bugs in loops are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Infinite loops**: the loop never stops because the condition never becomes `False`.\n",
    "- **Off-by-one errors**: your loop runs one time too many or one time too few.\n",
    "- **Wrong variable updates**: you forget to increment the counter or you update the wrong variable.\n",
    "- **Wrong index**: you refer to an index that is out of range (like `text[i+1]` or starting from 1 instead of 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging tip**: Use `print()` inside the loop to track what your variables are doing at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: a loop only stops when the condition is no longer true — so make sure your code *changes* something inside the loop!\n",
