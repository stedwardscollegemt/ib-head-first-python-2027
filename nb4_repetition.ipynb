    "#### Notes on For Loops and While Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways of creating `for` loops in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way is to write a `for` loop that repeats a block of code for each item `in` a sequence that can come from a `list`, `str`, or `file`, to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of looping through a `list` of `\"fruit\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit_seq = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit_item in fruit_seq:\n",
    "    print(fruit_item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**For Loop In `range()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common way of writing a `for` loop makes use of the `range()` function which generates a sequence of numbers. This is useful when you need to repeat an action a *specific number* of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "start, stop, step = 0, 5, 1\n",
    "for counter in range(start, stop, step):\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables `start` and `step` are technically *optional*, meaning, you do not have to specify them in your program. By default, Python will assume that you need to `start` counting from zero and increment by one `step`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember this from `nb1_sequential_programs.ipynb`?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for _ in range(3):\n",
    "    print(draw())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**While Loops in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a *test condition* is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_age = 34\n",
    "while my_age > 18:\n",
    "    print(\"Ugh! I am so old.\")\n",
    "    my_age = my_age - 1\n",
    "print(\"Yay! I am 18 again.\")\n",
    "```"

    "In Head First Python (Chapter 3 p. 83), the authors introduce a collection of sample data files in a folder called `swimdata` which you can find in this project. Each file contains swimming race times for a different athlete.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to start by listing the names of all the files in that directory before doing anything with the data inside them. This lets us practice loops in a real-world context. \n",

    "#### Note on Debugging Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging means finding and fixing errors (bugs) in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most common bugs in loops are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Infinite loops**: the loop never stops because the condition never becomes `False`.\n",
    "- **Off-by-one errors**: your loop runs one time too many or one time too few.\n",
    "- **Wrong variable updates**: you forget to increment the counter or you update the wrong variable.\n",
    "- **Wrong index**: you refer to an index that is out of range (like `text[i+1]` or starting from 1 instead of 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging tip**: Use `print()` inside the loop to track what your variables are doing at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: a loop only stops when the condition is no longer true — so make sure your code *changes* something inside the loop!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging Loops Exercises Activity\n",

    "**Exercise 1:** Explain why this loop never ends, and then fix the code.\n",
